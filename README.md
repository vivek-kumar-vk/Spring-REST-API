# 🌱 Spring-REST-API

This project is a demo Spring Boot application that showcases basic REST API functionalities including CRUD operations on a Department entity. It utilizes Maven for dependency management and project build, and H2 as an in-memory database for persistence.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java 17 and Maven installed on your machine.

2. **Clone the repository**:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
     
3. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   
   ```bash
   cd Spring-REST-API
   ```
   
4. **Run the application**:
   - Using Maven wrapper script:
     - For Unix-like operating systems:
     
       ```bash
       ./mvnw spring-boot:run
       ```
       
     - For Windows:
       
       ```bash
       mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
       ```
     
   - Using Maven:
   
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java/com/spring/SpringBootBasic**: Main application package.
  - **controller**: Contains `HelloController` and `DepartmentController` for handling HTTP requests.
  - **entity**: Contains `Department` entity class.
  - **repository**: Contains `DepartmentRepository` interface for CRUD operations on the database.
  - **service**: Contains `DepartmentService` interface and its implementation `DepartmentServiceImpl` for business logic.
  - **SpringBootBasicApplication.java**: Main class to run the Spring Boot application.

- **src/main/resources**:
  - **application.properties**: Configuration properties for the application, including database configuration.

- **src/test/java/com/spring/SpringBootBasic**: Contains `SpringBootBasicApplicationTests` for testing the application.

- **pom.xml**: Maven configuration file for project build and dependency management.

- **.mvn/wrapper**: Maven wrapper files for ensuring a consistent build environment.

- **mvnw** and **mvnw.cmd**: Maven wrapper scripts for Unix-like operating systems and Windows, respectively.

## Features

- **REST API Endpoints**: The application defines basic CRUD operations for a `Department` entity.
  - **Create**: `POST /departments`
  - **Read**: `GET /departments` and `GET /departments/{id}`
  - **Update**: `PUT /departments/{id}`
  - **Delete**: `DELETE /departments/{id}`

- **H2 Database**: Utilizes H2 in-memory database for persistence.

- **Spring Data JPA**: For repository layer abstraction.
